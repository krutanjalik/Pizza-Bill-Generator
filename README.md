# 🍕 Pizza Billing System (Java Project)

A **Java-based console application** that generates bills for pizza orders.
This project demonstrates the use of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts** such as **inheritance** and **method overriding** while providing a real-world scenario of billing.

---

## 🚀 Features

* Choose between **Vegetarian** or **Non-Vegetarian** pizzas.
* Option to add **extra cheese** or **additional toppings**.
* Automatically calculates the **final bill** based on selections.
* Implements **inheritance** and **overriding** for cleaner design and reusability.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Java (Core)**
* **OOP Concepts**: Inheritance, Encapsulation, Method Overriding

---

## 📂 Project Structure

* **`Pizza` (Base Class):** Handles common attributes and methods for pizzas.
* **`DeluxePizza` (Derived Class):** Extends `Pizza` with pre-included toppings and cheese.
* **`Main` Class:** Runs the application and simulates order creation with billing.
